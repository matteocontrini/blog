    title: Hi there ðŸ‘‹
    content: I'm Matteo and I'm from Italy. I (almost) have a master degree in Computer Science. I write code (mostly backend), I'm also interested in video streaming and compression technologies and live video production. I currently work at an edtech startup. I've also founded [FibraClick](https://fibra.click) and built [TrackBot](https://trackbot.eu). And this is my personal blog.
